# habanagaudi_awshackathon

This repository is made only for the sole purpose of being a demonstration test for the "Hackathon AWS Devpost Habana Gaudi". 

 The motor capacity of people is an essential aspect for their quality of life. 

 In the same way, being able to better predict diseases such as Parkinson's could represent a great advance in the field of medicine. 

 With an example model like this one could achieve: 

 1 - Evaluate and train people's motor skills 

 2- Adapting the model, the AI system could be taught to understand changes in writing patterns that would lead to suspect the presence of a disease such as Parkinson's, among others. 

This model is initially deployed on Intel Habana Gaudi DL1 machines on AWS. 

The foundations of this model emanate from (MNIST and Keras): https://github.com/fchollet/keras , http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
